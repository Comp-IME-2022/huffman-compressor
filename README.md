# Huffman Compressor

This repository is an implementation of a Huffman Compressor based on [this](youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8) video by Tom Scott: 

## Usage

Run the command `make` in the project directory to compile the encrypter, it will create an executable called Encrypter at `/bin` which can be used with 1 to 3 parameters:

- If 1 parameter is passed, then it compresses this file to output.bin and stores the Huffman tree at treeStore.txt

- If 2 parameters are passed, then it compresses the first file into the second one and stores the tree at treeStore.txt

- If 3 parameters are passed, then it compresses the first file into the second one and stores the three at the third
